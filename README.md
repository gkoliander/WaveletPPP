# WaveletPPP
Filtering of signals based on wavelet transform zeros

1) Place .flac file to process into the 'input' folder. 
2) Adapt parameters and flags in FilteringNoCircs.m
3) Run FilteringNoCircs.m

For statistics of modified pair correlation function and first intensity function:
4) Run quantilecalc.m
